## Development

To develop, install https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen

Then follow the steps to use the clj-discord library, https://github.com/yotsov/clj-discord#to-use-this-library

You'll need to set the GMNITRON_BOT_TOKEN & MONGODB_URI environment variables, which is the discord bot token and mongodb URI respectively.

To run the bot locally, use the `lein run` command.

## Todo/Upcoming Possible Features

* [Internal] Scene cleanup after 30 days
* [Internal] Some unit testing...

## Possible Features

* Mod tracking - Might be too much overhead
* Minion tracking - Sorta have this already with the minion/lt commands
