# gmnitron

A SCRPG Discord bot.

Provides dice rolling, scene tracking, and initiative tracking.

## Installation

To develop, install https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen.

Then you can run `lein run` inside the project root to run the bot locally.

You'll need to set the GMNITRON_BOT_TOKEN environment variable, which is the discord bot token.

## Usage

You can invite the bot via: [This Invite Link](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=425385281890418710&scope=bot)

## Todo/Upcoming Features
Going to add a `!recap` command that will consolidate the current `!scene` and `!round` commands. Not sure why I made them separate.
