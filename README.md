# gmnitron

A SCRPG Discord bot.

Provides dice rolling, scene tracking, and initiative tracking.

## Installation

To develop, install https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen .
Then you can run `lein run` inside the project root to run the bot locally.
You'll need to set the GMNITRON_BOT_TOKEN environment variable, which is the discord bot token.

## Usage

This section will be useful once finished.

## Todo/Upcoming Features
Going to add a `!recap` command that will consolidate the current `!scene` and `!round` commands. Not sure why I made them separate.
