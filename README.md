!mid (die 1) (die 2) (die 3) [modifiers]
!max (die 1) (die 2) (die 3) [modifiers]

```

#### Examples

```
!min 8 12 12
Rolled 3 (d12: 3, d8: 4, d12: 7)

!max d8 d6 d12 +2
Rolled 10 = 8 + 2 (d8: 3, d6: 5, d12: 8)

To develop, install https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen

Then follow the steps to use the clj-discord library, https://github.com/yotsov/clj-discord#to-use-this-library

You'll need to set the GMNITRON_BOT_TOKEN & MONGODB_URI environment variables, which is the discord bot token and mongodb URI respectively.

To run the bot locally, use the `lein run` command.

## Todo/Upcoming Possible Features

* Add a "current" actor to scenes, and have !pass change who that is
* Add a minion save vs roll
* Minion tracking
* Mod tracking?
* [Internal] Scene cleanup after 30 days
